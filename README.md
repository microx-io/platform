The microx.io platform is a complete, end-to-end opensource software devops solution, that let's you focus to bring software ideas from concept to production. In essence, it is an API to your software development process, making software development a process with a predictable and repeatable outcome - which is high-quality software design, full test coverage, fail-safe components. For small teams and large-scale enterprises.
